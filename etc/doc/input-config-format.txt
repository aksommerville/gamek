Gamek Input Config File Format

Line-oriented text.
'#' at start of line only, begins a line comment.

Every other line is a button mapping.
There must have been a device block introducer first.

SRCBTNID DSTBTNID LO HI FLAGS

SRCBTNID is an integer.

DSTBTNID is an integer or one of these symbols:
  LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN
  SOUTH NORTH WEST EAST
  L1 L2 R1 R2 AUX1 AUX2 AUX3
  HAT
  QUIT FULLSCREEN
  
LO,HI are the inclusive edge values.
A 3-state axis should have two rules, one for the low range and one for the high.

FLAGS are space-delimited tokens:
  ACTION       DSTBTNID names an action, not a button. Usually implied by the DSTBTNID token.
  LOWPRIORITY  Don't advance playerid_next. Add to every rule if you want it.
  PLAYER2      Rule applies to a second player using the same device. (but no more than 2)
  USAGE        SRCBTNID is the USB-HID Usage code, not the hardware button ID.
  CRITICAL     Reject a device if it doesn't match this button. Usually we use fuzzier heuristics.
