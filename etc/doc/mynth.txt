Mynth: Minimal Synthesizer

Unused MIDI things (ok to send them, but will be ignored):
  Note Off velocity.
  Note Adjust (per-note aftertouch).
  Program Change.
  Channel Pressure (global aftertouch).
  System and Realtime events, except 0xff Reset.
  
Running channels can be configured with Control Changes.
  0x07 Volume
  0x0c Attack time ms, minimum or no-velocity
  0x0d Attack level, ''
  0x0e Decay time ms, ''
  0x0f Sustain level, ''
  0x10 Release time 8ms, ''
  0x2c Attack time ms, maximum velocity
  0x2d Attack level, ''
  0x2e Decay time ms, ''
  0x2f Sustain level, ''
  0x30 Release time 8ms, ''
  0x40 Enable sustain
  0x46 Wave select, 0..7
  0x47 Wheel range, dimes.
  0x48 Warble range, dimes.
  0x49 Warble rate, hz.
  0x4a Warble phase: 0=rising ... 0x40=falling ... 0x7f=rising
  0x78 All Sound Off
  0x79 Reset Controllers
  0x7b All Notes Off
  
To define the envelope, set the low values first (0x0c..0x10), then high values (0x2c..0x30) if you want velocity sensitivity.

=== Song format ===

Songs are a serial dump of events with a short header:
  0   1 Tempo, ms/tick
  1   1 Start position, bytes. Always 4, but can be greater if this format changes in the future.
  2   2 Loop position, bytes.
  4
  
After the header are events, identifiable by the high bits of the first byte:
  00000000                   End of song.
  0nnnnnnn                   Delay (n) ticks.
  1000nnnn nnnnnnnn          Delay (n) ticks.
  1001cccc NNNNNNNv vvDDDDDD One-shot note. (c) chid, (N) noteid, (v) velocity, (D) duration ticks.
  1010cccc 0nnnnnnn 0vvvvvvv Note On. (c) chid, (n) noteid, (v) velocity.
  1011cccc 0nnnnnnn          Note Off.
  1100cccc kkkkkkkk vvvvvvvv Control Change. (k,v) normally in 0..127, but we do allow the full 8 bits.
  1101dddd vvvvvvvv          Pitch wheel. unsigned: 0x80 is default.
  111xxxxx ...               Reserved, illegal.
  
=== Wave format ===

Mynth at runtime expects waves provided as 512 signed 16-bit samples, one period of a wave.

Our "mkdata" tool can produce these waves from a sensible text format, conventionally named "*.wave".
One file produces one wave.
Each line is either empty, a line comment beginning '#', or a single operation to perform on the wave.
Comments are full lines only.
You start with a perfect sine wave.

shape NAME
  Overwrite with a pure shape: sine sawup sawdown square triangle noise silence
  "saw"="sawdown"
  
norm [LEVEL]
  Normalize peak to LEVEL (float 0..1). 1 if unspecified.
  
normrms [LEVEL]
  Normalize such that output RMS matches LEVEL before clipping.
  sqrt(2)/2 if unspecified (that's the RMS level of a pure sine wave).
  
clip [LEVEL]
  Force all samples to within -LEVEL..LEVEL, creating a plateau and discontinuity.
  We implicitly "clip 1" at the end regardless.
  
gate LEVEL
  Drop all samples within -LEVEL..LEVEL to zero.
  This is not usually something you'd want.
  
gain GAIN
  Multiply signal by GAIN (float).
  
average SAMPLECOUNT
  Looped moving average with a window of the given length. (1 is no-op).
  This is a crude low-pass filter.
  
phase PHASE
  Rotate signal in time by PHASE cycles, 0..1.
  
harmonics COEFFICIENTS...
  Combine the current wave with itself at multiple harmonics.
  COEFFICIENTS are floats, usually in 0..1.
  A single coefficient of 1 is no-op.
