Mynth: Minimal Synthesizer

Unused MIDI things (ok to send them, but will be ignored):
  Note Off velocity.
  Note Adjust (per-note aftertouch).
  Program Change.
  Channel Pressure (global aftertouch).
  System and Realtime events, except 0xff Reset.
  
Running channels can be configured with Control Changes.
  0x07 Volume
  0x0c Attack time ms, minimum or no-velocity
  0x0d Attack level, ''
  0x0e Decay time ms, ''
  0x0f Sustain level, ''
  0x10 Release time 8ms, ''
  0x2c Attack time ms, maximum velocity
  0x2d Attack level, ''
  0x2e Decay time ms, ''
  0x2f Sustain level, ''
  0x30 Release time 8ms, ''
  0x40 Enable sustain
  0x46 Wave select, 0..7
  0x47 Wheel range, dimes.
  0x48 Warble range, dimes.
  0x49 Warble rate, hz.
  0x4a Warble phase: 0=rising ... 0x40=falling ... 0x7f=rising
  0x78 All Sound Off
  0x79 Reset Controllers
  0x7b All Notes Off
  
To define the envelope, set the low values first (0x0c..0x10), then high values (0x2c..0x30) if you want velocity sensitivity.

=== Song format ===

Songs are a serial dump of events with a short header:
  0   1 Tempo, ms/tick
  1   1 Start position, bytes. Always 4, but can be greater if this format changes in the future.
  2   2 Loop position, bytes.
  4
  
After the header are events, identifiable by the high bits of the first byte:
  00000000                   End of song.
  0nnnnnnn                   Delay (n) ticks.
  1000nnnn nnnnnnnn          Delay (n) ticks.
  1001cccc NNNNNNNv vvDDDDDD One-shot note. (c) chid, (N) noteid, (v) velocity, (D) duration ticks.
  1010cccc 0nnnnnnn 0vvvvvvv Note On. (c) chid, (n) noteid, (v) velocity.
  1011cccc 0nnnnnnn          Note Off.
  1100cccc kkkkkkkk vvvvvvvv Control Change. (k,v) normally in 0..127, but we do allow the full 8 bits.
  1101dddd vvvvvvvv          Pitch wheel. unsigned: 0x80 is default.
  111xxxxx ...               Reserved, illegal.
